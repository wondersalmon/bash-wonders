 # Bash-wonders
### A repository where I learn to write wonderful things in the form of bash scripts


>  ##### This is not a single project, but a set of scripts for different tasks. I write scripts when:
>
> 1.   I would like to practice bash shell
> 2.   I need it for work tasks
> 3.   When I'm bored

***Hope these guys can be helpful to you. Enjoy.***
